      <p>What a book! Just finished this book and the emotions going through are just something that cannot be put to words. It is a feel-good book where the resilience in every character will resonate with you and help you find a deeper meaning in your life. It is not just a novel, it gives a psychological view into how mother nature is so abundant and giving and we just take so many things for granted. The book has been beautifully written as to how Atharava has matured from his high school sweetheart, a loving father, an understanding son, to a matured man with Erica. So much to say about the book but unable to put into words. But, surely it is a book that would change the way you view your life.<br>Dive into it and get immersed in Atharava's beautiful world built by the strong resilient woman around him.</p>
